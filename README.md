# Thesis

This study aims to predict the converting sessions of an E-commerce company in the automotive sector. The main challenge that this study addresses is the severe class imbalance in an E-commerce setting.  The methods that are applied are of two families. Data level methods include oversampling, undersampling and hybrid sampling. Algorithm level methods compose of cost sensitive learning and thresholding. The comparative analysis shows that cost sensitive learning combined with XGBoost shows the highest performance in terms of Average Precision and PR AUC on the train and the test set. Further thresholding is applied to optimize the confusion matrix and obtain the best f1 score via increasing Precision and Recall for this model.
